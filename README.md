# Anthropology Statistical Model Building

For this project, I worked with Alan Farahani to build statistical models to gain insight into paleoethnobotanical data. Throughout this project, we:
- Explored past research on paleothnobotanical data  
- Cleaned and analyzed the datasets of interest with plant remain count information  
- Fit models including the Linear, Log Linear, Poisson, and Negative Binomial models to the data  
- Created an R Shiny App to display these results and visualizations  

In addition, we presented at the Society for American Archaeologyâ€™s Conference in April 2021 to discuss how platforms such as R and R Shiny can allow for a greater use of interactive archaeological tools and visualizations in research and education.
